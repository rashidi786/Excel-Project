Hayat Store Data Analysis ---  This project analyzes sales patterns on various online platforms like Amazon, Flipkart, and Ajio using Excel spreadsheets. Insights from the data have helped store managers increase sales by optimizing strategies. Through this project, I enhanced my data analysis skills and gained a deeper understanding of e-commerce trends.

Coffee Sales Dashboard ---   This project showcases an interactive Coffee Sales Dashboard created in Excel. It features 4 slicers connected to 3 charts providing real-time insights into sales, product performance, and customer data. I used advanced Excel formulas such as:

   =INDEX(products!$A$1:$G$49, MATCH(orders!$D2, products!$A$1:$A$49, 0), MATCH(orders!$H$1, products!$A$1:$G$1, 0))
   =XLOOKUP(C2, customers!$A$1:$A$1001, customers!$I$1:$I$1001, 0)
   
These formulas helped extract precise data, demonstrating my ability to handle complex data manipulation tasks. This project has enhanced my skills in data analysis and Excel and prepared me to explore the data analytics field in the market.
